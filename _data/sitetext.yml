My story"
    body: "Hi my name is Emma and I am currently studying a Bachelor of Health Science (Nutrition and Exercise) finishing late 2022.
Recently I have also decided achieve both a nutrition, health and wellness coaching certification and a more specialised women's health and wellness coaching certification, both of which I hope to finish in 2022 or early 2023. 
## Previous education and experience:
I have obtained a Bachelor of Education (Secondary) and a Bachelor of Arts. I spent 2004-2011 teaching VCE Psychology and Media in secondary schools in Melbourne, Australia.
In 2011 I left the teaching profession when my eldest son was born. I went on to add another son to our family in 2014.
In 2014 I also started my own creative business which you can find at www.emkiedesigns.com 
I am no longer developing this business, however I still enjoy spending my free time sewing and being creative.
## My 'why?'
In September 2016 I saw some photos of myself and decided something needed to change. When I first saw the pictures I was extremely unhappy and I barely recognised myself. I didn't know how I had gotten so overweight. I mean, I hated exercise and only went to the gym once or twice a week - if I could be bothered. I also loved food, I had grown up with food allergies, and have always been a 'picky' eater. My diet mainly consisted of bread, not many vegetables, and chicken, I loved ice-cream, chocolate, and chips, so having no nutrition knowledge definitely wasn't helping! Over a 4 year span I worked to changed my lifestyle by adjusting my diet and exercising consistently for the first time in my life! These lifestyle changes helped me lose over 20kg. I gained more energy, confidence and self-love through this process. In 2020 I struggled with what I thought was emotional eating but was eventually diagnosed as an eating disorder. Thankfully I had help recovering from this and because of this history, I am passionate about helping others achieve a good relationship with food while working towards their health goals. 
I began my Bachelor of Health Science (Nutrition and Exercise) degree in 2019 as a result of my health journey. I hope to be able to help my clients achieve their health goals, and make them feel as though they always have a cheerleader in their corner.
